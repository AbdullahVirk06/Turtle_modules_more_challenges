🏁 TURTLE RACE GAME CODE
===============================================================

from turtle import Turtle, Screen
import random

Screen setup

is_race_on = False
screen = Screen()
screen.setup(width=500, height=400)
user_bet = screen.textinput(
title="Make your bet",
prompt="Which turtle will win the race? (red/orange/green/blue/coral/pink): "
)

Turtle setup

y_positions = [-70, -40, -10, 20, 50, 80]
colors = ["red", "orange", "green", "blue", "coral", "pink"]
all_turtles = []

for turtle_index in range(6):
new_turtle = Turtle(shape="turtle")
new_turtle.color(colors[turtle_index])
new_turtle.penup()
new_turtle.goto(x=-230, y=y_positions[turtle_index])
all_turtles.append(new_turtle)

Start race if user placed a bet

if user_bet:
is_race_on = True

Race loop

while is_race_on:
for turtle in all_turtles:
if turtle.xcor() > 230:
is_race_on = False
winning_color = turtle.pencolor()
if winning_color == user_bet:
print(f"You've won! The {winning_color} turtle is the winner! 🏆")
else:
print(f"You've lost! The {winning_color} turtle won the race. 😅")
rand_distance = random.randint(0, 10)
turtle.forward(rand_distance)

Close screen on click

screen.exitonclick()

✅ **Now this single file contains:**
- Full game code  
- Complete README at the top (inside docstring)  
- Perfect for GitHub upload — just name it `turtle_race.py`  

Would you like me to include a **finish line drawing** in the same file too (so it looks more like a real race track)?
