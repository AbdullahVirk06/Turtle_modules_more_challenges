# 🐢 Turtle Race Game

A fun and interactive Python project using the `turtle` graphics library.  
Bet on your favorite turtle and see if your pick wins the race! 🏁  

---

## 🎮 How It Works

1. When you run the program, a text box appears asking:

2. Choose a color — that’s your turtle.  
3. Six turtles line up at the starting point.  
4. Each turtle moves a random distance every frame.  
5. The first turtle to cross the finish line wins!  

You’ll see a message in the console:
- ✅ **You’ve won!** if your turtle color matches the winner.  
- ❌ **You’ve lost!** otherwise.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **For Loops** → create and control multiple turtles  
- **While Loop** → keep the race going  
- **If Conditions** → check for the winner  
- **Random Module** → make each race different  
- **Turtle Functions**
- `Turtle()` — create turtle objects  
- `Screen()` — create window  
- `textinput()` — take user bet  
- `goto()` — position turtles

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- `turtle` (comes pre-installed with Python)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

🚀 Future Upgrades

Add a finish line graphic

Show results in a popup instead of console

Countdown timer before the race starts

Sound effects and speed boosts
